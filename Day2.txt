Write a blog on the difference between document and window object.


JavaScript, as a versatile and dynamic programming language, interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate and control elements on a web page. Two fundamental objects in this interaction are the document and window objects.


scope:

 1. Window object represents the global browser window or tab. It serves as the entry point for interacting with browser environment. 
 2. The document object represents the entire HTML document loaded in the browser. It provides access to the content and structure of the document.

Properties:

 1. Window object contains properties related to the browser window, such as innerWidth, innerHeight, and location. Provides information about the browser environment. 
 2. Document object contains properties like title, URL, and body. Represents elements within the HTML document.

 Methods:

 1. Window object hosts methods like alert(), confirm(), and setTimeout(). 
 2. Document object hosts methods for document manipulation, such as getElementById(), querySelector(), and createElement(). Enables dynamic changes to the document structure and content


 Events:

 1. Window object Manages global functionalities and events. Variables declared without the var, let, or const keyword become global variables implicitly.
 2. Document object captures and handles events related to the document, such as clicks, keypresses, and form submissions. Facilitates user interaction and responsiveness.


Differences: 

Global vs. Document-Specific:

 1. The window object deals with global browser properties and functionalities. 
 2. The document object focuses on the content and structure of the loaded HTML document.

 Interaction with Elements::

 1. Window object manages the overall browser environment, the document object is crucial for interacting with specific HTML elements.
 2. Document object contains properties like title, URL, and body. Represents elements within the HTML document.

 Scope of Properties:

 1. Global variables are properties of the window object, accessible globally.
 2. Document-specific properties and methods are encapsulated within the document object.

 Manipulating Content:

 1. The document object is the primary tool for dynamically manipulating the content and structure of the HTML document. 
 2. The window object provides methods for managing the global environment and initiating user interactions.
